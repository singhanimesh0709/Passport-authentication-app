 <link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="https://bootswatch.com/4/sketchy/bootstrap.min.css"
  />

  to actually include a bootswatch theme, justdownload the bootstap.min.css from the site and replace in place of the link of bootstrap in your code in the head tag.
  and make this file part of your static folder, in our case which is public. if we put it in any other file then it wont work.
